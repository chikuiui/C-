                       STATIC MEMBERS AND FUNCTIONS


-> When we have static data members we should need some static functions for
   modifying and accessing static data members.
-> We can also access and modify static data members through normal functions
   but it is considered as bad practice.
-> Static functions don't have any this pointer.

Static Members :-
-> Shared among all objects.
-> created once.
-> defined outside the class.

class Player{
  public:
    static int count;
    Player(){count++;}
    ~Player(){count--;}
    static int getCount(){return count;}
}

int Player :: count = 0; // must define outside the class.

int main(){
  Player p1;
  cout << Player :: count << endl;
  Player p2;
  cout << Player :: count << endl;
  {
    Player p3;
    cout << Player :: count << endl;
  }
  cout << Player :: count << endl;
  cout << Player :: getCount() << endl;
}

output ->    1
             2
             3
             2
             2
