                                              DESTRUCTORS

-> opposite of constructors.
-> There can be only one destructor in class unlike constructors.
-> It is called when an object is destroyed.
-> Destructor is called when object goes out of the scope.
-> Destructor are initialized by default.
->(IMP) When we are allocating memory dynamically in the class then we need our own destructor.

NOTE -> when you have multiple objects in the same scope they are destroyed in reverse order of 
        their creation.


Ex ->   class Test{
             int x;
           public:
             Test(int i){
                x = i;
             }
             ~Test(){//some code}
         };
