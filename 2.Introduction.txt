#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
   cout << "HEllo" << endl;  

   return 0;
}




 1. # -> Preprocessor
 2. iostream -> header file
 3. namespace -> to avoid name collision.
 4. cout -> standard output
 5. cin -> standard input.
 6. main() -> The function where execution of c++ code begins.
 7. return 0 -> function successful execution.
 8. endl -> insert new line and flushes the stream(output buffer).

Preprocessor -> It is a software which runs before complilation.
             -> It process these files include the declaration of the function
                written in header file.
Header file  -> It contain some declarations,classes,functions which used in program.

NOTE 1.-> we should avoid using void main() instead of int main() because when program
        execution complete in int main() it return 0 so than machine will know that 
        program executes successfully but in void main() don't return anything so 
        machine will not know so it can be abnormal case.

NOTE 2.-> we should avoid using namespace because suppose we have two header file 
          and both header file contain same function name but different code inside
          so complier will not know which defination is being used and it create an 
          ambiguity in program.
