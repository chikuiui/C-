Memory -> array of bytes.

Variable -> it represent a memory location associated with name.


Datatypes :-
   Three types of datatype

Primary -> bulit in
Derived -> derived from the primitive or built in datatypes
User Defined -> defined by user itself

   Primary                     Derived                  User Defined

-> Integer                  -> Function               -> Class
-> Character                -> Array                  -> Structure
-> Boolean                  -> Pointer                -> Union
-> Float                    -> Reference              -> Enum
-> Double                                             -> Typedef


sizeof() -> gives you size of datatype.


   Local Variable                                    Global Variable
-> Declared inside function                       -> Declared outside function
-> Accessed only inside function.                 -> Any function can access it.
-> Initialized with random value.                 -> Initialized with default value(for int is 0)
-> stored in stack.                               -> stored in RAM



-> complier doesn't allow to create multiple variable with same name in same scope.

Static variable :-
  -> static local variable are initialized as 0 when created.
  -> it wll stay throughout the program till its termination.
  -> static variable are allocated during compile time.
  -> static variables are stored in RAM.  

const variable :-
  -> const variable  means it cannot be modified.
