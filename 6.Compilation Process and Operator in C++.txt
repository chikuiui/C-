   Operators in C++ :-

1. Arithmatic Operators :-
    +  -  /  *  %  ++  --

   NOTE-> If using unary operator(++,--) in a single statement multiple times then the behaviour of program will
          depend on compiler.
   NOTE-> C++ exclusive type casting function =  static_cast<datatype>()

2. Relational Operator :-
    <  >  ==  >=  <=  !=
    
   used in conditional statements and loops.

3. Logical Operator :-
   &&  ||  !
   
   && and || are both binary operator they require two operand to perform.
   ! is unary opertor means only require one operand to perform.

4. Assignment operator :-
   =  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  <<=  >>=  
   
   much faster compare to normal ways.
