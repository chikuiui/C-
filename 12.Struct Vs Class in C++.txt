-> A class has all the members are private by default.
-> In structure things are public by default.

  Note -> we can make class members public and structure members private.

-> Like classes we can have constructors,destructors,functions in a struct.


Que.  When to use structure and when to use class?
->    we can always use struct in place of class and class in place of struct.
      But as a general practice we use structure when we only want to bundle multiple items together.
      But when we care about OOP and data hiding we use classes in general.
      (Classes emphasises on data hiding,that's why things are private by default).
