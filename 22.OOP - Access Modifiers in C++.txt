                                          Access Modifiers in C++

-> Access modifiers are used to implement an important aspect of Object-Oriented Programming known as Data Hiding.
-> There are 3 types of access modifiers available in C++ :-
   1.Public
   2.Private
   3.Protected

1.Public :-
 -> The public members are accessible from any part of the program.

2.Private :-
 -> The private members of the class cannot be accessed outside the class.

3.Protected :- (related to inheritance)
 -> Not accessable outside the class except inherited class.
