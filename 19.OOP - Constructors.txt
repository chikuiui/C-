                                                         CONSTRUCTORS 

  (I am using "They" because there can be multiple constructors in a class)

-> constructors are special functions.
-> They have same name as a class.
-> They is used to initialize the data members of the class
-> They do not have any return type.
-> They are called when your object is created(whether using stack or heap).
-> Compler automatically create a constructor if user don't write a constructor.
   (This default constructor may initialize data-members with random value)

example->
         class Complex{
           private:
             int real;
             int imag;
           public:
             Complex(int r,int i){  // This is a constructor.
              real = r;
              imag = i;
             }
             void print(){
              cout << real << " " << imag << endl;
             }
          };
  
          int main(){
             Complex c(10,20); // calling constructor when creating an object of Complex class.
          }
