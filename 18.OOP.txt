     OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

-> It is a way to build a software and a program.
-> we can use functional programming when the size of program is small but when we have to design a complex 
   software that contain multiple entities and these entities interact with each other then we use OOP.
-> C++ support OOP and functional programming both.
-> we can create an object using stack and heap both.

   CLASS  -> A datatype with functions. (an blueprint that contains some attributes like functions and data members.
   OBJECT -> A varible of a class. (an instance of a class).

class Complex{
   private:
     int real;
     int imag;
   public:
     Complex(int r,int i){
       real = r;
       imag = i;
     }
     void print(){
       cout << real << " " << imag << endl;
     }
};
