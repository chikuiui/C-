 Loops in C++ :-

-> To do something repeatedly.
-> To iterate through containers like array,list,etc.
-> To run something forever like web server or other system services.


 Functions :-

A block of code which only runs when it is called.

-> you can pass parameters into a function.


 Application of functions :-

 -> Avoid code redundancy(means duplicate code)
 -> Code maintain.
 -> Make code modular (by using multiple diff functions instead of writing everyting on main())
 -> Abstraction (we can use functions present in header files without knowing how they written/work)

More on functions :-
 1.inline functions :-
   -> It is a concept which is used for small functions.
   -> inline function avoid function call overhead.
   -> modern complier automatically convert a function inline if it is eligible.
 
 2. Function overloading :-
   -> property of polymorphism
   -> same name with different parameters.
    
   ex->  void print(int i){// some code}  and void print(int i,int j){// some code}
   NOTE -> THIS WILL NOT WORK -> int fun() and double fun()
 
 3. Default Arguments :-
    -> It is a feature of polymorphism.
    ex ->   int add(int a,int b=0,int c=0){return a+b+c};
            int main(){
               cout << add(1) << endl;
               cout << add(1,2) << endl;
               cout << add(1,2,3) << endl;
            }
     all works fine.
    NOTE -> default arguments should be created from right to left.
