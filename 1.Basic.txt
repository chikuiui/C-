C++ is a programming language.
 
    1. Its close to hardware.
    2. It contain pointers and memory access functions.
    3. It can write device driver and OS(operating systems)
       (Most of the operating systems are written in c and c++)
    
Q.Why C++?
->C++ program are generally faster than Java and Python because its a 
  complied language.

Q.What is Compiled Language?
->C++ program convert source code into binary code in one go then we have
  executable code(machine dependent).

         Machine dependent -> only runs on particular machine.

         Java and Python are interpreted language it convert source code into 
         binary code line-by-line then we have executable code(machine independent).
         Due to property of machine independent java and python are famous.

                 C++ --> 1.low level programming and high level programming.
                         2.Fast execution.
                         3.Derived From C.
                         4.Richer library than C.
                         5.Object Oriented Programming.

NOTE ->> JAVA CONTAIN MORE CODE COMPARE TO C++ BUT JAVA CODE ARE MUCH MORE 
         MAINTAINABLE.C++ ALLOWS US TO WRITE BAD CODE BUT JAVA DOESN'T.

APPLICATIONS :-
     1.Chrome,Firefox.
     2.Adobe Products.
     3.Most of the OS written in C++.
     4.Game Drivers,Device Drivers.
