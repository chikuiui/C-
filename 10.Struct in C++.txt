                                STRUCT IN C++

-> Structure is also called user define-datatype.
-> It allow us to store multiple items together.
-> These multiple items can be of any data-type.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


struct Point{
	int x;
	int y;
};

int main(){
	Point p;   // In C++ it is not mandidatory to use struct in front of object but in C we have to use "struct Point p;"  
	// we can use this also Point p = {10,20}; this will also work.
        p.x = 10;
	p.y = 20;
        cout << p.x << " " << p.y << endl;
}


Some Points on Struct :-
   1. struct is a c type construct.
   2. It was added to C programming language to support composite(multiple) datatype.
   3. Since C++ supports everything that C supports bcoz of backward compatibility thats why structure is included
      in C++ also.
   
NOTE -> C++ has a construct called Class which can do almost everything that we can do with a struct.

TO access a structure member using a pointer we use '->' 
              Ex ->  Point p = {10,20};
                     Point *ptr = p;
                     p->x = 12;
                     p->y = 13;
